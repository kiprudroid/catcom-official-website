    aboutPatronSaint:
      "St Martin (1579-1639) was born in Lima, Peru. He was the illegitimate son of a nobleman and possibly an African woman slave. He had a younger sister but soon after her birth, their father abandoned them.St Martin grew up in poverty with his mother who, unable to support him, sent him for two years to a Care School and then to work and train with a barber/surgeon.St Martin devoted his life to the sick, the poor and praying to the Blessed Sacrament. As a Lay Brother, he begged for alms to feed the hungry, the sick and his Dominican community. Often when there was no more space in their infirmary, he would give patients his own small bed.",
    prayer:
      "O glorious Saint Martin, whose burning charity embraced all, especially the poor and needy, we humbly turn to you for your intercession. May we, like you, be moved by compassion and generosity, and may we always strive to follow your example of humility and service to others. Saint Martin, pray for us, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Amen",

      "Mary was a first-century Jewish woman of Nazareth, the wife of Joseph and the mother of Jesus. She is an important figure of Christianity, venerated under various titles such as virgin or queen, many of them mentioned in the Litany of Loreto. God's “first” thought in creating was Jesus. Jesus, the incarnate Word, is the one who could give God perfect love and worship on behalf of all creation. As Jesus was “first” in God's mind, Mary was “second” insofar as she was chosen from all eternity to be his mother.",

      "ST Veronicah SCC was formed in the year 2010 around September. Before then, there were only 5 SCCs: St Mary's, St Martin, St Charles Lwanga, St Paul (nicknamed CMA) and St Jude. Due to the increase in number of CATCOM members, it was suggested that more SCC's be formed to accommodate more catcomers. The then chairman, Erick Otieno appointed a committee to come up with the structure. The report suggested that there be added three more SCC's. two to cater for those residing in University hostels and an additional one to cater for those renting outside the University. Three SCC's were formed namely: St Veronica SCC, St Stephen SCC and St Therese of the Child Jesus SCC.At around November the same year, the SCC was commissioned by the then Father in Charge, Rev Fr Francis Kiarie, St Augustine Parish. Worth noting, Irene was the first chair lady, and during her time the families were formed. Then the scc could meet once in a week on Thursdays at the halls of residence from 7:00 PM. Later on, the meeting was transferred to lecture halls e.g. SCC, NCLB.",

      "Saint Charles Lwanga, born in 1860 in Buganda (modern-day Uganda), was a Christian convert and one of the 22 Catholic martyrs who died for their faith under King Mwanga II's persecution. Serving as a page in the royal court, he became a leader among the Christian converts and protected young boys from the king's immoral advances. Amid growing hostility, he was baptized and encouraged his fellow believers to remain steadfast. Arrested and condemned, he was burned alive on June 3, 1886, at Namugongo, showing immense courage and devotion until his last breath. Canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1964, he is honored as the patron saint of youth, converts, and African Catholics. His feast day, celebrated with his fellow martyrs, remains a significant event in Uganda and beyond, inspiring Christians to stand firm in their faith despite persecution",

Your unwavering love for Christ inspires us to live lives of integrity and courage.

Accused of blasphemy, he was brought before the Sanhedrin, where he delivered a speech recounting Israel's history and condemning the religious leaders for resisting God's will. Enraged, they dragged him outside Jerusalem and stoned him to death, during which he prayed for his persecutors.Among those witnessing his execution was Saul of Tarsus, who later became Saint Paul.feast day is celebrated on December 26",

      "Most holy Apostle, St. Jude, faithful servant and friend of Jesus, I place myself into your hands at this difficult time.Help me to know that I am not alone. Please pray for me, asking God to send me comfort for my sorrows, bravery for my fears, and healing for my suffering. Ask our loving God to strengthen my faith and give me the courage to accept His Will for my life. Thank you, St. Jude, for the hope you offer to all who believe in you. Amen.",

    about:
      "The SCC is comprised of three families; the Favoured family, the Arelis family, and the Sacred Heart family. The family heads spearhead the family activities and they are also part of the SCC executive and hence act as a link between the families and the SCC executive. Families usually meet regularly at their convenience for various activities such as games night, prepare and take dinner together. On Thursdays and Sundays, SCC members gather for holy rosary prayers and a variety of activities. The community cherishes the sense of connection and support fostered through these gatherings and every meeting offers a chance to engage in meaningful interactions and strengthen the bonds among the group members making these gatherings both spiritually and socially rewarding for all members. Each gathering is both enriching and enjoyable, strengthening the bonds within the group and making these experiences spiritually and socially rewarding. These activities reflect the group's commitment to holistic growth and community engagement.",

    aboutPatronSaint:
      "Saint Paul, originally named Saul, was born around 5 AD in Tarsus, a prominent city in modern-day Turkey. He came from a devout Jewish background, was a Roman citizen, and was highly educated in Jewish law under the renowned rabbi Gamaliel. As a Pharisee, he zealously upheld the Mosaic Law and initially persecuted early Christians, believing them to be a threat to Judaism.His life dramatically changed on the road to Damascus when he had a vision of Jesus. This experience left him temporarily blind, but after three days, he regained his sight and converted to Christianity. Taking the name Paul, he dedicated his life to spreading the gospel.",
    prayer:
      "Holy St. Paul, you taught others about the saving message of Jesus, intercede for us so that Christ may live in us. Help us to know and imitate you and your love for Jesus. It is through your writings that many people have come to know Jesus, may all people know and glorify God through your writings and intercession.",
